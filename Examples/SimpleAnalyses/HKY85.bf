/* This is an example HY-PHY Batch File.   It reads in a '#' nucleotide dataset data/hiv.nuc and estimates   maximum ln-likelihood based on the tree contained in the data file,   using Hasegawa et all 85 (HKY 85) model with transition/transversion ratio   estimated independently for all branches.      Output is printed out as a Newick Style tree with branch lengths   representing the number of expected substitutions per branch (which   is the default setting for nucleotide models w/o rate variation).   Sergei L.
