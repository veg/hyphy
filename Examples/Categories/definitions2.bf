/* This is an example HY-PHY Batch File.	In this file, we will illustrate how to define category	variables sampled from continuous distribution to model rate heterogeneity.	   Sergei L. Kosakovsky Pond and Spencer V. Muse    June 2001. *//* 1. We begin with a simple distribution:	it has 4 equiprobable rate classes		The first argument in defining a category variable is the number of rate classes.		The second argument defines the probability of each class. We set it to	EQUAL.		The third argument determines how the continuous distribution is sampled:		MEAN - weighted (conditional) mean over an interval		MEDIAN - median of the interval		SCALED_MEDIAN - medians of the intervals scaled so that the discretized		distribution has the same mean as the continous one.		The fourth argument is the density of the distribution that we are sampling;	Let us begin with the exponential random variable over [0,Inf].	Its density is 				f(_x_) = lambda Exp(-lambda _x_). 		It MUST be defined in terms of "_x_" (and  other parameters if applicable, e.g "lambda" here).	"_x_" is the variable of integration.		The fifth argument is the CDF of the distribution that we are sampling.	It can be left blank to suggest that HyPhy numerically integrate the density,	but should always be specified if known, because it will GREATLY improve the speed.	It must also be defined in terms of _x_ and specify P{X<=_x_}.	For the exponential random variable the CDF is:			F(_x_) = 1-Exp(-lamda _x_).		The sixth and seventh arguments are the bounds of the support of the distribution.	([0,1e25] in this case: 1e25 -or any other large number- is Inf). 	The seventh (optional) argument is only used if "MEAN" sampling is requested.	It is the formula which gives the intergal of x f(x) over the interval (-Inf, _x_].	It is used for computing conditional means. If this argument is not supplied, 	HyPhy will perform numerical integration (which is much slower than direct evaluation).		For the exponential random variable it is:		-_x_ Exp (-lambda _x_) + (1-Exp(-lambda _x_)/lambda*//* this will display the category info, along with sample mean and variance */#include "displayFunction.bf";global lambda = 2;category catVar =  (4,		/* number of rates */					EQUAL,  /* probs. of rates */					MEAN,	/* sampling method */					lambda*Exp(-lambda*_x_), /* density */					1-Exp(-lambda*_x_), /*CDF*/					0, 				   /*left bound*/					1e25, 			   /*right bound*/					-_x_*Exp(-lambda*_x_) + (1-Exp(-lambda*_x_))/lambda 						/* "antiderivative" of x f(x) */				   );fprintf (stdout,"1). 4 equiprobable rates sampled from Exponential with lambda = 2\n");GetInformation (catInfo,catVar);fprintf (stdout, "\nSample by MEAN:");catInfo = echoCatVar (catInfo);/* note that sample mean if 1/2 as expected, because it is the mean of exponential with lambda = 2,   sample variance if close to 1/4 which is what it is for the continuous case.
